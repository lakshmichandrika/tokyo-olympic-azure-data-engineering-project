# tokyo-olympic-azure-data-engineering-project
Project Overview:

This is an end-to-end data engineering project on the Azure cloud. Where I did data ingestion from GITHUB to Azure Data Lake using Data Factory to transformation using Databricks loading to Synapse, and reporting using Power BI. 

Project Goals:

•	Establish a connection between GITHUB and Azure cloud.

•	Ingest tables into the Azure Data Lake Storage.

•	Apply data cleaning and transformation using Azure Databricks.

•	Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics for loading clean data.

•	Create interactive data visualizations and reports with Microsoft Power BI.

Dataset Used:

This contains the details of over 11,000 athletes, with 47 disciplines, along with 743 Teams taking part in the 2021(2020) Tokyo Olympics. This dataset contains the details of the Athletes, Coaches, Teams participating as well as the Entries by gender. It contains their names, countries represented, discipline, gender of competitors, name of the coaches.
